To successfully begin playtesting the mod, you are required the following:

A full, legal install of Fallout 4 including all of it's DLC.
A set of mods, linked below:
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14253
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20309
These mods are mandatory. No way around them. You will also need the Fallout 4 Script Extender, otherwise horrible things may happen.

Please also follow the instructions to enable the usage of loose files here:
https://www.creationkit.com/fallout4/index.php?title=Enable_Loose_Files

If you don't many of the mod's features will not show up, as alot of it's files are replacements for already existing items. 

Installation of the mod is rather simple. Don't use any mod manager, you'll have to install it manually. Which means taking the extracted
files and drag them into your Fallout 4 Data folder. 


We won't provide any further instructions on how to install those mods, as you should know how to do it when you want to participate here.
