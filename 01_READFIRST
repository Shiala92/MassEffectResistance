# MassEffectResistance
This site is solely used for all things that are in direct correlation with the modding behind Mass Effect Resistance. Please make sure to first read through existing files to see if your problem or idea has already been posted and try to keep it as clean as possible.

What we need? If you encounter a bug or crash, we will need as much information as you can provide. Location, what you were doing, what you had equipped and so on.

Please do not pester any modder with repeated reports of your bugs. If it is inside one of the correct files, we will get to it. We can't do everything at once.
